# Downloads
In order to run the code you'll need weights initialisation.
Good thing is to ask to lovely-Marc for the files.
Best thing is to BRIBE Marc for the files :D

You need to download some files at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8tQbRXEAWraNnhJb21DNlNtTG8?usp=sharing at put them in your files architectures as follows
1. ./caffe_layers_value.pickle
2. ./models/PERSO/PERSO.VGG16_CAM_W_S.rmsProp.1e-5/model-24
3. ./models/PERSO/PERSO.VGG16_CAM_W_S.rmsProp.1e-5/model-24.meta
